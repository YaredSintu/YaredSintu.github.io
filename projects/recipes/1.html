    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe for Doro Wat holds a special place in our family, often
      prepared during festive occasions and gatherings. It is typically made
      with chicken pieces stewed in a flavorful sauce made from onions, garlic,
      ginger, and a blend of spices such as berbere. Doro wat is often served
      with injera, a traditional Ethiopian flatbread, and is a staple dish in
      Ethiopian celebrations and holidays. As my grandmother always said, "Doro
      Wat brings us together with its rich flavors and heritage."

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For a richer flavor, marinate the chicken in lemon juice and salt for at
        least an hour before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the amount of berbere spice according to your heat preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using niter kibbeh adds a traditional depth of flavor, but vegetable oil
        works as a substitute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with traditional Ethiopian injera bread to soak up the delicious
        sauce.
