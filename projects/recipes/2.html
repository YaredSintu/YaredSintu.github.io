    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Tibs is a beloved Ethiopian dish that features sautéed meat, typically
      beef or lamb, cooked with a medley of vegetables and spices. It is a
      versatile dish that can be enjoyed on various occasions, from casual
      family meals to special gatherings. The meat is often seared to perfection
      and combined with onions, garlic, peppers, and tomatoes, creating a
      flavorful and aromatic dish. Tibs is commonly served with injera, the
      traditional Ethiopian flatbread, making it a hearty and satisfying meal.
      As my father used to say, "Tibs is the taste of home, full of warmth and
      tradition."

    <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

        For a spicier version, increase the amount of berbere spice blend to
        your taste.
